Definitions

The definitions in OAR 340-200-0020, 340-204-0010 and this rule apply to this division. If the same term is defined in this rule and 340-200-0020 or 340-204-0010, the definition in this rule applies to this division.

(1) "Abate" means to eliminate the nuisance or suspected nuisance by reducing or managing the emissions using reasonably available practices. The degree of abatement will depend on an evaluation of all of the circumstances of each case and does not necessarily mean completely eliminating the emissions.

(2) "Nuisance" means a substantial and unreasonable interference with another's use and enjoyment of real property, or the substantial and unreasonable invasion of a right common to members of the general public.

(3) "Special control area" means an area designated in OAR 340-204-0070.

NOTE: This rule is included in the State of Oregon Clean Air Act Implementation Plan that EQC adopted under OAR 340-200-0040.

Visible Air Contaminant Limitations

(1) The emissions standards in this rule do not apply to:

(a) Fugitive emissions from a source or part of a source; or

(b) Recovery furnaces regulated under OAR chapter 340, division 234.

(2) The visible emissions standards in this rule are based on the average of 24 consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals, or more frequently as allowed under subsection (b), which comprise a six-minute block. Six-minute blocks need not be consecutive in time and in no case may two blocks overlap. For each set of 24 observations, the six-minute block average is calculated by summing the opacity of the 24 observations and dividing the sum by 24. Six-minute block averages are measured by:

(a) EPA Method 9;

(b) A continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) installed and operated in accordance with the DEQ Continuous Monitoring Manual or 40 C.F.R. part 60 [NOTE: DEQ manual is published with OAR 340-200-0035]; or

(c) An alternative monitoring method approved by DEQ that is equivalent to EPA Method 9.

(3)(a) For all emissions units, no person may emit or allow to be emitted any visible emissions that equal or exceed an average of 20 percent opacity, except as allowed under subsection (b) or (c).

(b) For wood-fired boilers installed, constructed or last modified on or after June 1, 1970 but before April 16, 2015, visible emissions may equal or exceed an average of 20 percent opacity for up to two independent six-minute blocks in any hour, as long as the average opacity during each of these two six-minute blocks is less than 40 percent;

(c) For wood-fired boilers installed, constructed or last modified prior to June 1, 1970:

(A) Visible emissions may equal or exceed an average of 20 percent opacity but may not equal or exceed 40 percent opacity, as the average of all six-minute blocks during grate cleaning operations provided the grate cleaning is performed in accordance with a grate cleaning plan approved by DEQ; or

(B) DEQ may approve, at the owner’s or operator’s request, a boiler specific limit greater than an average of 20 percent opacity, but not to equal or exceed an average of 40 percent opacity, based on the opacity measured during a source test that demonstrates compliance with OAR 340-228-0210(2)(d) and:

(i) Opacity must be measured for at least 60 minutes during each compliance source test run using any method included in section (2);

(ii) The boiler specific limit will be the average of at least 30 six-minute block averages obtained during the compliance source test;

(iii) The boiler-specific limit will include a higher limit for one six-minute period during any hour based on the maximum six-minute block average measured during the compliance source test;

(iv) Specific opacity limits will be included in the permit for each affected source as a minor permit modification (simple fee) for sources with an Oregon Title V Operating Permit or a Basic Technical Modification for sources with an Air Contaminant Discharge Permit; and

(v) If an alternative limit is established in accordance with this paragraph, the exception provided in paragraph (A) does not apply.

Requirements for Fugitive Emissions

(1) No person may cause or permit any materials to be handled, transported, or stored; or a building, its appurtenances, or a road to be used, constructed, altered, repaired or demolished; or any equipment to be operated, without taking reasonable precautions to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne. Such reasonable precautions may include, but not be limited to the following:

(a) Use, where possible, of water or chemicals for control of dust in the demolition of existing buildings or structures, construction operations, the grading of roads or the clearing of land;

(b) Application of water or other suitable chemicals on unpaved roads, materials stockpiles, and other surfaces which can create airborne dusts;

(c) Full or partial enclosure of materials stockpiles in cases where application of water or other suitable chemicals are not sufficient to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne;

(d) Installation and use of hoods, fans, and fabric filters to enclose and vent the handling of dusty materials;

(e) Adequate containment during sandblasting or other similar operations;

(f) Covering, at all times when in motion, open bodied trucks transporting materials likely to become airborne;

(g) The prompt removal from paved streets of earth or other material that does or may become airborne.

(2) When fugitive particulate emissions escape from an air contaminant source, DEQ may order the owner or operator to abate the emissions. In addition to other means, DEQ may order that a building or equipment in which processing, handling and storage are done be tightly closed and ventilated in such a way that air contaminants are controlled or removed before being emitted to the open air.

(a) For purposes of this section, fugitive emissions are visible emissions that leave the property of a source for a period or periods totaling more than 18 seconds in a six-minute period. The minimum observation time must be at least six minutes unless otherwise specified in a permit.

(b) Fugitive emissions are determined by EPA Method 22 at the downwind property boundary.

(3) If requested by DEQ, the owner or operator must develop a fugitive emission control plan, including but not limited to the work practices in section (1), that will prevent any visible emissions from leaving the property of a source for more than 18 seconds in a six-minute period following the procedures of EPA Method 22.

Nuisance Control Requirements: Nuisance Prohibited

(1) No person may cause or allow air contaminants from any source subject to regulation by DEQ to cause a nuisance.

(2) Upon determining a nuisance may exist, DEQ will provide written notice to the person creating the suspected nuisance. DEQ will endeavor to resolve observed nuisances in keeping with the policy outlined in OAR 340-012-0026. If DEQ subsequently determines a nuisance exists under 340-208-0310 and proceeds with a formal enforcement action, pursuant to OAR 340 division 12, the first day for determining penalties will be no earlier than the date of this notice.

340-208-0310
Nuisance Control Requirements: Determining Whether A Nuisance Exists

(1) In determining whether a nuisance exists, DEQ may consider factors including, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Frequency of the emission;

(b) Duration of the emission;

(c) Strength or intensity of the emissions, odors or other offending properties;

(d) Number of people impacted;

(e) The suitability of each party's use to the character of the locality in which it is conducted;

(f) Extent and character of the harm to complainants;

(g) The source's ability to prevent or avoid harm.

(2) Compliance with a best work practices agreement that identifies and abates a suspected nuisance constitutes compliance with OAR 340-208-0300 for the identified nuisance. For sources subject to 340-216-0020 or 340-218-0020, compliance with specific permit conditions that results in the abatement of a nuisance associated with an operation, process or other pollutant emitting activity constitutes compliance with 340-208-0300 for the identified nuisance. For purposes of this section, "permit condition" does not include the general condition prohibiting the creation of nuisances.

Nuisance Control Requirements: Best Work Practices Agreement

(1) A person may voluntarily enter into an agreement with DEQ to implement specific practices to abate the suspected nuisance. This agreement may be modified by mutual consent of both parties. This agreement will be an Order for the purposes of enforcement under OAR 340 division 12.

(2) For any source subject to OAR 340-216-0020 or 340-218-0020, the conditions outlined in the best work practices agreement will be incorporated into the permit at the next permit renewal or modification.

(3) This agreement will remain in effect unless or until DEQ provides written notification to the person subject to the agreement that:

(a) The agreement is superseded by conditions and requirements established later in a permit;

(b) DEQ determines the activities that were the subject of the agreement no longer occur; or

(c) DEQ determines that further reasonably available practices are necessary to abate the suspected nuisance.

(4) The agreement will include one or more specific practices to abate the suspected nuisance. The agreement may contain other requirements including, but not limited to:

(a) Monitoring and tracking the emission of air contaminants;

(b) Logging complaints and the source's response to the complaint;

(c) Conducting a study to propose further refinements to best work practices.

(5) DEQ will consult, as appropriate, with complainants with standing in the matter throughout the development, preparation, implementation, modification and evaluation of a best work practices agreement. DEQ will not require that complainants identify themselves to the source as part of the investigation and development of the best work practices agreement.
