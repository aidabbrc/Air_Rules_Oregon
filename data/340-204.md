(1)(a) All areas in Oregon, except as otherwise provided under OAR 340-204-0050, are designated Class II as of December 5, 1974;

(b) Redesignation, except as otherwise precluded by OAR 340-204-0050, may be proposed by DEQ, as provided below, subject to approval by the EPA Administrator as a revision to the SIP.

(2) DEQ may submit to the EPA Administrator a proposal to redesignate areas of the state Class I or II provided that:

(a) At least one public hearing has been held in accordance with procedures established in the SIP;

(b) Other states, Indian Governing Bodies, and Federal Land Managers whose lands may be affected by the proposed redesignation were notified at least 30 days prior to the public hearing;

(c) A discussion of the reasons for the proposed redesignation, including a satisfactory description and analysis of the health, environmental, economic, social and energy effects of the proposed redesignation, was prepared and made available for public inspection at least 30 days prior to the hearing and the notice announcing the hearing contained appropriate notification of the availability of such discussion;

(d) Prior to the issuance of notice respecting the redesignation of an area that includes any federal lands, DEQ has provided written notice to the appropriate Federal Land Manager and afforded adequate opportunity, not in excess of 60 days to confer with DEQ respecting the redesignation and to submit written comments and recommendations. In redesignating any area with respect to which any Federal Land Manager had submitted written comments and recommendations, DEQ must have published a list of any inconsistency between such redesignation and such comments and recommendations together with the reasons for making such redesignation against the recommendation of the Federal Land Manager; and

(e) DEQ has proposed the redesignation after consultation with the elected leadership of local general purpose governments in the area covered by the proposed redesignation.

(3) Any area other than an area to which OAR 340-204-0050 refers may be redesignated as Class III if:

(a) The redesignation would meet the requirements of section (2);

(b) The redesignation, except any established by an Indian Governing Body, has been specifically approved by the Governor, after consultation with the appropriate committees of the legislature, if it is in session, or with the leadership of the legislature, if it is not in session, unless state law provides that the redesignation must be specifically approved by state legislation, and if general purpose units of local government representing a majority of the residents of the area to be redesignated enact legislation or pass resolutions concurring in the redesignation;

(c) The redesignation would not cause, or contribute to, a concentration of any regulated pollutant which would exceed any maximum allowable increase permitted under the classification of any other area or any ambient air quality standard; and

(d) Any permit application for any major stationary source or major modification, subject to review under section (1), which could receive a permit under this section only if the area in question were redesignated as Class III, and any material submitted as part of that application, were available insofar as was practicable for public inspection prior to any public hearing on redesignation of the area as Class III.

(4) Lands within the exterior boundaries of Indian Reservations may be redesignated only by the appropriate Indian Governing Body.

(5) The EPA Administrator may disapprove, within 90 days of submission, a proposed redesignation of any area only if he finds, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that such redesignation does not meet the procedural requirements of this paragraph or is inconsistent with OAR 340-204-0050. If any such disapproval occurs, the classification of the area must be that which was in effect prior to the redesignation which was disapproved.

(6) If the EPA Administrator disapproves any proposed redesignation, DEQ may resubmit the proposal after correcting the deficiencies noted by the EPA Administrator.

Priority Sources

For the purposes of division 224, priority sources are identified as follows:

(2) In any other area, DEQ may identify priority sources during a specific permit action based on the sources addressed in the emission reduction strategies that were included in the attainment or maintenance plans for the area. The offset value for priority sources identified under this section must be determined by DEQ. The offset values for replacement of uncertified residential wood fuel-fired devices in OAR 340-240-0560 may only be used if DEQ determines that the values reasonably apply to the geographical area in question.
