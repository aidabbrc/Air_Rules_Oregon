Ambient Air Quality Standards: Purpose and Scope of Ambient Air Quality Standards

(1) An ambient air quality standard is an established concentration, exposure time, and frequency of occurrence of an air contaminant or multiple contaminants in the ambient air that must not be exceeded. The ambient air quality standards set forth in OAR 340-202-0050 through 340-202-0130 were established to protect both public health and public welfare.

(2) Ambient air quality standards are not generally used to determine the acceptability or unacceptability of emissions from a specific source of air contamination. More commonly, the measured ambient air quality is compared with the ambient air quality standards to determine the adequacy or effectiveness of emission standards for all sources in a general area. However, if a source or combination of sources are singularly responsible for a violation of ambient air quality standards in a particular area, it may be appropriate to impose emission standards that are more stringent than those otherwise applied to the class of sources involved. Similarly, proposed construction of new sources or expansions of existing sources, that may prevent or interfere with the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards are grounds for issuing an order prohibiting such proposed construction as authorized by ORS 468A.055 and pursuant to OAR 340-210-0205 through 340-210-0250, and OAR 340-218-0190. No source may cause or contribute to a new violation of an ambient air quality standard or PSD increment even if the single source impact is less than the significant impact level.

(3) In adopting the ambient air quality standards in this division, the EQC recognizes that one or more of the standards are currently being exceeded in certain parts of the state. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the EQC to achieve, by application of a timely but orderly program of pollution abatement, full compliance with ambient air quality standards throughout the state at the earliest possible date.

Ambient Air Quality Standards: Suspended Particulate Matter

Concentrations of the fraction of suspended particulate that is equal to or less than ten microns in aerodynamic diameter in ambient air as measured by an approved method must not exceed:

(1) 150 micrograms of PM10 per cubic meter of air as a 24-hour average concentration for any calendar day.

Concentrations of the fraction of suspended particulate that is equal to or less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter in ambient air as measured by an approved method must not exceed:

(2) 35 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air as a 3-year average of annual 98th percentile 24-hour average values recorded at each monitoring site. This standard is attained when the 3-year average of annual 98th percentile 24-hour average concentrations is equal to or less than 35 micrograms per cubic meter as determined in accordance with Appendix N of 40 CFR 50.

(3) 12 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air as a 3-year average of the annual arithmetic mean. This standard is attained when the annual arithmetic mean concentration is equal to or less than 12 micrograms per cubic meter as determined in accordance with Appendix N of 40 CFR 50.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration Increments: General

(1) The purpose of OAR 340-202-0200 through 340-202-0220 is to implement a program to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in the State of Oregon as required by the FCAA Amendments of 1977.

(2) DEQ will review the adequacy of the SIP on a periodic basis and within 60 days of such time as information becomes available that an applicable increment is being violated. Any SIP revision resulting from the reviews will be subject to the opportunity for public hearing in accordance with procedures established in the SIP.
