GENERAL AIR POLLUTION PROCEDURES AND DEFINITIONS
340-200-0010
Purpose and Application

(1) This division provides general air pollution procedures and definitions that apply to all air quality rules in OAR 340 divisions 200 through 268.

(2) Divisions 200 through 268 apply in addition to all other rules adopted by the EQC. In cases of apparent conflict between rules within these divisions, the most stringent rule applies unless otherwise expressly stated.

(3) DEQ administers divisions 200 through 268 in all areas of the State of Oregon except when the EQC has designated LRAPA to administer rules within its area of jurisdiction. Subject to, and when provided in divisions 200 through 268, LRAPA is authorized by the EQC as the agency to implement these state rules, and must apply the requirements and procedures contained in these state rules, within its area of jurisdiction. LRAPA may apply any LRAPA rule in lieu of a state rule(s) provided that the LRAPA rule is at least as strict as the state rule(s), LRAPA has submitted the rule to the EQC for its approval, and the EQC has not disapproved the rule.

NOTE: This rule is included in the State of Oregon Clean Air Act Implementation Plan that EQC adopted under OAR 340-200-0040.

(3) "Actual emissions" means the mass emissions of a regulated pollutant from an emissions source during a specified time period as set forth in OAR chapter 340, divisions 214, 220 and 222.

(4) "Adjacent", as used in the definitions of major source and source and in OAR 340-216-0070, means interdependent facilities that are nearby to each other.

(5) "Affected source" means a source that includes one or more affected units that are subject to emission reduction requirements or limitations under Title IV of the FCAA.

(6) "Affected states" means all states:

(a) Whose air quality may be affected by a proposed permit, permit modification, or permit renewal and that are contiguous to Oregon; or

(b) That are within 50 miles of the permitted source.

(7) "Aggregate insignificant emissions" means the annual actual emissions of any regulated pollutant from one or more designated activities at a source that are less than or equal to the lowest applicable level specified in this section. The total emissions from each designated activity and the aggregate emissions from all designated activities must be less than or equal to the lowest applicable level specified:

(a) One ton for total reduced sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric acid mist, any Class I or II substance subject to a standard promulgated under or established by Title VI of the FCAA, and each criteria pollutant, except lead;

State of Oregon Clean Air Act Implementation Plan

(1) This implementation plan, consisting of Volumes 2 and 3 of the State of Oregon Air Quality Control Program, contains control strategies, rules and standards prepared by DEQ and is adopted as the State Implementation Plan (SIP) of the State of Oregon under the FCAA, 42 U.S.C.A 7401 to 7671q.

(2) Except as provided in section (3), revisions to the SIP will be made under the EQC’s rulemaking procedures in OAR chapter 340, division 11 of this chapter and any other requirements contained in the SIP and will be submitted to the EPA for approval. The SIP was last modified by the EQC on May 23, 2024.

(3) Notwithstanding any other requirement contained in the SIP, DEQ may:

(a) Submit to the EPA any permit condition implementing a rule that is part of the federally-approved SIP as a source-specific SIP revision after DEQ has complied with the public hearings provisions of 40 C.F.R. 51.102; and

(b) Approve the standards submitted by LRAPA if LRAPA adopts verbatim, other than non-substantive differences, any standard that the EQC has adopted, and submit the standards to EPA for approval as a SIP revision.

(4) Revisions to the State of Oregon Clean Air Act Implementation Plan become federally enforceable upon approval by the EPA. If any provision of the federally approved State Implementation Plan conflicts with any provision adopted by the EQC, DEQ must enforce the more stringent provision.

Compliance Schedules

(1) DEQ's goal is to encourage voluntary cooperation of all persons responsible for an air contamination source. To facilitate this cooperation and provide for a progressive program of air pollution control, DEQ may negotiate with such persons to establish a compliance schedule for meeting the requirements contained in the applicable air quality rules or statutes. The schedule will set forth the conditions with which the responsible person must comply.

(a) The schedule may be accepted in lieu of a hearing. It must be in writing and signed by the Director of DEQ or his designated officer and an authorized agent of the responsible person. After the schedule is executed by both parties, it must be confirmed by order of DEQ;

(b) Compliance schedules providing for final compliance at a date later than 18 months from the date of execution must contain requirements for periodic reporting and increments of progress toward compliance, at intervals of less than 18 months;

(c) No compliance schedule may allow emissions on a permanent basis in excess of applicable standards and rules.

(2) If a negotiated schedule of compliance cannot be established, DEQ may commence enforcement proceedings as provided by ORS 468.090 or take such other authorized action as may be warranted.
