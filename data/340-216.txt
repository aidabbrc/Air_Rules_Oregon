Applicability and Jurisdiction

(1) This division applies to all sources listed in OAR 340-216-8010. This division also applies to Oregon Title V Operating Permit program sources when an ACDP is required by 340-218-0020 or 340-224-0010. Sources referred to in 340-216-8010 are subject to fees in 340-216-8020.

(2) Owners or operators of sources in any one of the categories in OAR 340-216-8010 must obtain a permit. Source categories are not listed in alphabetical order. If a source meets the requirements of more than one of the source categories and the source is not eligible for a Basic ACDP or a General ACDP that has been authorized by DEQ, then the owner or operator of the source must obtain a Simple or Standard ACDP. DEQ may determine that a source is ineligible for a Basic ACDP or a General ACDP based upon the considerations in OAR 340-216-0025(7).

(a) Owners or operators of commercial and industrial sources listed in OAR 340-216-8010 Part A must obtain a Basic ACDP under 340-216-0056 unless the person chooses to obtain a General, Simple or Standard ACDP for the source. For purposes of Part A, production and emission parameters are based on the latest consecutive 12 month period, or future projected operation, whichever is higher. Part A eligibility cutoffs are based on actual production, throughput, or material usage of the source, as applicable.

(b) Owners or operators of sources in any one of the categories in OAR 340-216-8010 Part B must obtain one of the following unless otherwise allowed in Part B:

(A) A General ACDP, if one is available for the source classification and the source qualifies for a General ACDP under OAR 340-216-0060;

(B) A Simple ACDP under OAR 340-216-0064; or

(C) A Standard ACDP under OAR 340-216-0066 if the source fits one of the criteria of Part C or does not qualify for a Simple ACDP.

(c) Owners or operators of sources in any one of the categories in OAR 340-216-8010 Part C must obtain a Standard ACDP under the procedures set forth in OAR 340-216-0066.

(3) No person may construct, install, establish, develop or operate any air contaminant source listed in OAR 340-216-8010 without first obtaining an ACDP from DEQ or LRAPA and keeping a copy onsite at all times, unless otherwise deferred from the requirement to obtain an ACDP in subsection (3)(c) or DEQ has granted an exemption from the requirement to obtain an ACDP under subsection (3)(d). No person may continue to operate an air contaminant source if the ACDP expires, or is terminated, denied, or revoked; except as provided in OAR 340-216-0082.

(a) The owner or operator must construct and operate their facility in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, including any corrections or revisions approved by DEQ, previously submitted in the application required under OAR 340-216-0040.

(b) For portable sources, a permit may be issued or assigned by:

(A) DEQ for operation in any area of the state except Lane County; or

(B) LRAPA for operation in Lane County.

(c) The owner or operator of a source required to obtain an ACDP or ACDP Attachment in order to comply with a NESHAP under OAR chapter 340, division 244 or a NSPS under OAR chapter 340, division 238, is not required to submit an application for an ACDP or ACDP Attachment until four months after the effective date of the EQC’s adoption of the NESHAP or NSPS, and is not required to obtain an ACDP or ACDP Attachment until six months after the EQC’s adoption of the NESHAP or NSPS. In addition, DEQ may defer the requirement to submit an application for, or to obtain an ACDP or ACDP Attachment, or both, for up to an additional twelve months, subject to paragraphs (A) and (B).

(A) Deferrals of Oregon permitting requirements do not relieve an air contaminant source from the responsibility of complying with applicable federal NESHAP or NSPS requirements.

(B) OAR 340-216-0060(1)(b)(A), 340-216-0062(2)(b)(A), 340-216-0064(4)(a), and 340-216-0066(3)(a), do not relieve a permittee from the responsibility of complying with federal NESHAP or NSPS requirements that apply to the source even if DEQ has not incorporated such requirements into the permit.

(d) DEQ may exempt a source from the requirement to obtain an ACDP if it determines that the source is subject to only procedural requirements, such as notification that the source is affected by an NSPS or NESHAP.

(4) No person may construct, install, establish, or develop any source that will be subject to the Oregon Title V Operating Permit program without first obtaining an ACDP, unless the source may be placed onsite and operated without any other construction necessary and obtains an Oregon Title V Operating Permit prior to operation.

(5) The owner or operator of a source that has been issued an ACDP may not modify the source without first complying with the requirements of OAR 340-210-0205 through 340-210-0250.

(6) The owner or operator of a source required to have an ACDP may not make modifications to the source that would result in the source becoming subject to the Oregon Title V Operating Permit program without complying with the requirements of OAR 340-210-0205 through 340-210-0250.

(7) The owner or operator of a source required to have an ACDP may not increase emissions above the PSEL without first applying for and obtaining a modified ACDP.

(8) The owner or operator of a source that has been issued an ACDP may not violate any conditions included in the ACDP.

(9) Subject to the requirements in this division and OAR 340-200-0010(3), LRAPA is designated by the EQC to implement the rules in this division within its area of jurisdiction.

(4) Any person who fails to submit any relevant facts or who has submitted incorrect information in a permit application must, upon becoming aware of such failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts or corrected information.

(5) Permit applications must be completed in full and signed by the applicant or the applicant's legally authorized representative.

(6) When a permit application is subject to Major NSR under OAR chapter 340, division 224, a copy of the permit application, including all supplemental and supporting information, must also be submitted directly to the EPA.

(7) The name of the applicant on a permit application must be the legal name of the facility’s owner, the owner's agent or the lessee responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. The legal name must be registered with the Oregon Secretary of State Corporations Division, unless the applicant is an individual person that is operating the facility or applying for the permit, and is not doing so under an assumed business name.

(8) All permit applications must include the appropriate fees as specified in OAR 340-216-8020 and OAR 340-216-8030.

(9) Permit applications that are obviously incomplete, unsigned, improperly signed, or lacking the required exhibits or fees will be rejected by DEQ and returned to the applicant for completion.

(10) Within 15 days after receiving the application, DEQ will preliminarily review the application to determine the adequacy of the information submitted, and:

(a) If DEQ determines that additional information is needed, DEQ will promptly ask the applicant for the needed information and provide the applicant with a written request to provide such information by a date, not to exceed a 60-day period;

(b) An applicant may request an extension of time from a deadline established in subsection (a) by providing DEQ with a written request 15 days prior to the submittal deadline. DEQ may grant an extension based on the following criteria:

(A) The applicant has demonstrated progress in completing the submittal; and

(B) A delay is necessary, for good cause shown by the applicant, related to obtaining more accurate or new data, performing additional analyses, or addressing changes in operations or other key parameters, any of which are likely to have a substantive impact on the outcomes of the submittal;

(c) If DEQ determines it is not able to approve the applicant’s submittal, or if the applicant does not timely provide additional information or corrections requested by DEQ under subsection (a), then in addition to any other remedies available, DEQ may issue a proposed denial of the application under OAR 340-209-0080(6);

(d) If DEQ has determined that additional information or corrections are necessary under subsection (a), and except as provided in subsection (c), DEQ will not consider the application to be complete for processing until DEQ has received the requested information; and

(e) When DEQ has determined that the information in an application is adequate for processing, DEQ will so notify the applicant in writing.

(11) If at any time while processing the permit application, DEQ determines that additional information is needed, DEQ will follow the procedures in section (10) to request such information.

(12) If, upon review of an application, DEQ determines that a permit is not required, DEQ will so notify the applicant in writing. Such notification is a final action by DEQ on the application.

Construction ACDP

(1) Purpose. A Construction ACDP is a permit for approval of Type 3 construction or modification changes as specified in OAR 340-210-0225 and 340-210-0240. The Construction ACDP includes requirements for the construction or modification of stationary sources or air pollution control devices and does not by itself provide authorization to operate the new construction or modification. A new or modified Standard ACDP or Oregon Title V Operating Permit is required before operation of the new construction or modification. A Construction ACDP may be used for the following situations:

(a) For complex construction or modification projects that require an extended period of time to construct, the Construction ACDP may provide construction approval faster than issuance of a Standard ACDP or modified Standard ACDP because the operating requirements would not need to be included in the permit.

(b) For Oregon Title V Operating Permit sources, the Construction ACDP may include the requirements of OAR 340-218-0050 and follow the external review procedures in OAR 340-218-0210 and 340-218-0230 so that the requirements may later be incorporated into the Oregon Title V Operating Permit by an administrative amendment. If the applicant elects to incorporate the Construction ACDP by administrative amendment, all of the application submittal, permit content, and permit issuance requirements of OAR 340 division 218 must be met for the Construction ACDP.

(2) Application requirements. Any person requesting a Construction ACDP must:

(a) Submit an application according to OAR 340-216-0040 and provide the information specified in 340-216-0040(1) as it relates to the proposed new construction or modification; and

(b) Provide a list of any applicable requirements related to the new construction or modification.

(3) Fees. Applicants for a Construction ACDP must pay the fees in OAR 340-216-8020.

(4) Permit content. A Construction ACDP must include at least the following:

(a) A requirement that construction must commence within 18 months after the permit is issued if required by OAR 340-224-0030(4);

(b) A requirement to construct according to approved plans;

(c) A requirement to comply with all applicable requirements;

(d) Emission limits for affected stationary sources;

(e) Performance standards for affected stationary sources and air pollution control devices;

(f) Performance test requirements;

(g) Monitoring requirements, if specialized equipment is required (e.g., continuous monitoring systems);

(h) Notification and reporting requirements (construction status reports, startup dates, source test plans, CEMS performance specification testing plans, etc.);

(i) General ACDP conditions for incorporating generally applicable requirements;

(j) A requirement to modify the operating permit before commencing operation of the new construction or modification;

(k) A permit expiration date of no more than 5 years; and

(l) Oregon Title V Permit requirements as specified in OAR 340-218-0050, if the applicant requests the external review procedures in 340-218-0210 and 340-218-0230.

(5) Permit issuance procedures:

(a) A Construction ACDP requires that DEQ provide public notice according to OAR 340 division 209 as a Category III permit action.

(b) For sources subject to the Oregon Title V Operating Permit program, the applicant may ask for the external review procedures in OAR 340-218-0210 and 340-218-0230 in addition to the requirements of OAR 340 division 209 to allow the Construction ACDP to be incorporated into the Oregon Title V Operating Permit at a later date by an administrative amendment provided the requirements of subsection (1)(b) are met.

(c) Issuance of a modified Construction ACDP requires the following public notice, as applicable:

(A) Public notice as a Category I permit action under OAR 340 division 209 for non-technical modifications and basic and simple technical modifications; or

(B) Public notice as a Category II permit action under OAR 340 division 209 for moderate and complex technical modifications.

(6) Construction ACDPs may not be renewed.

(b) Attachment content. Each General ACDP Attachment must include the following:

(A) All relevant requirements for the operations covered by the General ACDP Attachment, excluding any federal requirements not adopted by the EQC;

(B) Testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable emissions limits and standards; and

(C) An attachment expiration date not to exceed 10 years from the date of issuance.

(c) Attachment issuance public notice procedures: A General ACDP Attachment requires public notice as a Category II permit action according to OAR 340 division 209.

(d) DEQ will retain all General ACDP Attachments on file and make them available for public review at DEQ's headquarters.

(3) Source assignment:

(a) Application requirements. Any person requesting to be assigned to a General ACDP Attachment must submit a written application for each requested General ACDP Attachment that specifies the requested General ACDP Attachment and shows that the source qualifies for the requested General ACDP Attachment.

(b) Fees. Applicants must pay the fees in OAR 340-216-8020 for each assigned General ACDP Attachment. The fee class for each General ACDP Attachment is Fee Class Five.

(c) Assignment procedures:

(A) Assignment to a General ACDP Attachment is a Category I permit action and is subject to the Category I public notice requirements under OAR 340 division 209.

(B) A person is not a permittee under the General ACDP Attachment until DEQ assigns the General ACDP Attachment to the person.

(C) Assignment to a General ACDP Attachment terminates when the General ACDP Attachment expires or is modified, terminated or revoked.

(D) A source may not be assigned to a General ACDP Attachment for a source category in a higher annual fee class than the General ACDP to which the source is currently assigned. Instead a source must be reassigned to the General ACDP for the source category in the higher annual fee class according to OAR 340-216-0060(2)(c)(E) and may be assigned to one or more General ACDP Attachments associated with source categories in an equal or lower annual fee class.

(d) If all activities at a source cannot be addressed by a General ACDP and General ACDP Attachments, the owner or operator of the source must apply for a Simple or Standard ACDP according to this division.

Simple and Standard ACDP Attachments

(1) Purpose. This rule allows DEQ to add new requirements to existing Simple or Standard ACDPs by assigning the source to an ACDP Attachment issued under section (2). An ACDP Attachment would apply to an affected source until the new requirements are incorporated into the source’s Simple or Standard ACDP at the next permit renewal or at the time of permit modification.

(2) ACDP Attachment issuance procedures:

(a) An ACDP Attachment issuance requires public notice as a Category II permit action under OAR chapter 340, division 209.  Assigning ACDP Attachments to Simple or Standard ACDPs require notice as Category I permit actions.

(b) DEQ may issue an ACDP Attachment when there are multiple sources that are subject to the new requirements.

(c) Attachment content. Each ACDP Attachment must include the following:

(A) Testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable emissions limits and standards; and

(B) An attachment expiration date not to exceed 5 years from the date of issuance.

(3) Assignment to ACDP Attachment:

(a) A source is not a permittee under the ACDP Attachment until DEQ assigns the ACDP Attachment to the source.

(b) The ACDP Attachment is removed from the Simple or Standards ACDP when the requirements of the ACDP Attachment are incorporated into the source’s Simple or Standard ACDP at the time of renewal or of a modification.

(c) If an EPA or DEQ action causes a source to be subject to the requirements in an ACDP Attachment, assignment to the ACDP Attachment is a DEQ initiated modification to the Simple or Standard ACDP and the permittee is not required to submit an application or pay fees for the permit action. In such case, DEQ would notify the permittee of the proposed permitting action and the permittee may object to the permit action if the permittee demonstrates that the source is not subject to the requirements of the ACDP Attachment.

Toxic Air Contaminant Permit Addendums

(1) Purpose and Intent. DEQ may implement requirements pertaining to toxic air contaminants under OAR chapter 340, division 245 as follows:

(a) For new sources required to obtain a Standard or Simple ACDP, by including conditions in the source’s ACDP to ensure compliance with the Cleaner Air Oregon rules, OAR chapter 340, division 245;

(b) For new sources required to obtain a Basic or General ACDP, by including conditions in an addendum to the source’s ACDP to ensure compliance with the Cleaner Air Oregon rules, OAR chapter 340, division 245; and

(c) For existing sources, by requiring the owner or operator of the sources to obtain a Toxic Air Contaminant Permit Addendum under OAR chapter 340, division 245 that amends the source’s ACDP.

(2) A Toxic Air Contaminant Permit Addendum will be incorporated into a source’s ACDP upon renewal or modification that involves a public notice for which DEQ has followed the Category II or Category III public notice procedure in OAR chapter 340, division 209, except for sources that have Basic or General ACDPs.

(3) OAR 340-216-0062 and 340-216-0068 do not apply to Toxic Air Contaminant Permit Addenda.

Expiration, Termination, Reinstatement or Revocation of an ACDP

(1) Expiration.

(a) A source may not be operated after the expiration date of a permit, unless any of the following occur prior to the expiration date of the permit:

(A) A timely and complete application for renewal or reassignment has been submitted; or

(B) Another type of permit, ACDP or Oregon Title V Operating Permit, has been applied for or issued authorizing operation of the source.

(b) If a timely and complete renewal or reassignment application has been submitted, the existing permit will remain in effect until final action has been taken on the renewal application to issue or deny a permit.

(c) For a source operating under an ACDP or Oregon Title V Operating Permit, a requirement established in an earlier ACDP remains in effect notwithstanding expiration of the ACDP, unless the provision expires by its terms or unless the provision is modified or terminated according to the procedures used to establish the requirement initially.

(2) Termination. Except as provided in section (3), a source may not be operated after the termination of a permit. A permit terminates upon:

(a) Issuance of a renewal, reassigned ACDP or a new ACDP for the same activity or operation;

(b) Written request by the permittee to DEQ requesting termination. If DEQ determines that a permit is no longer needed, DEQ will confirm termination in writing to the permittee;

(c) Failure to submit a timely and complete application for permit renewal or reassignment as required in OAR 340-216-0040. Termination is effective on the permit expiration date;

(d) Failure to pay annual fees within 90 days of the invoice due date as issued by DEQ, unless prior arrangements for a payment plan have been approved in writing by DEQ.

(3) Termination of construction approval.

(a) Construction approval issued by DEQ under this division terminates and is invalid for the following reasons:

(A) Construction is not commenced within 18 months after DEQ issues such approval, by an alternative deadline established by DEQ under this section, or by the deadline approved by DEQ in an extension under subsection (b);

(B) Construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more; or

(C) Construction is not completed within 18 months of the anticipated date of construction completion included in the application.

(b) The owner or operator of a source for which construction approval has been terminated under subsection (a) may submit a request to extend the construction commencement deadline by submitting a written, detailed explanation of why the source could not commence construction within the initial 18-month period. DEQ may grant for good cause one 18-month construction approval extension.

(4) Reinstatement of Terminated Permit.

(a) A permit subject to termination under subsection (2)(c) may only be reinstated if, not later than 30 days after the permit expiration date, the permittee submits a complete renewal application and pays a late application fee equivalent to the initial new permitting application fee that would apply if the source was a new source, in which case the existing, expired permit will be reinstated effective as of the permit expiration date and will remain in effect until final action has been taken on the renewal application to issue or deny a permit;

(b) A permit terminated under subsection (2)(d) may only be reinstated if, not later than 90 days after termination, the permittee pays all unpaid annual fees and applicable late fees in which case the existing permit will be reinstated effective on the date of termination; and

(c) A terminated permit may only be reinstated as provided in subsections (a) and (b). If neither subsection (a) or (b) apply, the former permittee of a terminated permit who wishes to obtain an ACDP must submit a complete application for a new permit, including paying applicable new source permit application fees and any unpaid annual fees and late fees that were due under the terminated permit. Until DEQ issues or reassigns a new permit, the source may not operate.

(5) Revocation:

(a) If DEQ determines that a permittee is in noncompliance with the terms of the permit, submitted false information in the application or other required documentation, or is in violation of any applicable rule or statute, DEQ may revoke the permit. DEQ will provide notice of the intent to revoke the permit to the permittee under OAR 340-011-0525. The notice will include the reasons why the permit will be revoked, and include an opportunity for the permittee to request a contested case hearing prior to the revocation. A permittee’s written request for hearing must be received by DEQ within 60 days from service of the notice on the permittee, and must state the grounds of the request. The hearing will be conducted as a contested case hearing under ORS 183.413 through 183.470 and OAR chapter 340, division 011. The permit will continue in effect until the 60th day after service of the notice on the permittee, if the permittee does not timely request a hearing, or until a final order is issued if the permittee timely requests a hearing.

(b) If DEQ finds there is a serious danger to the public health, safety or the environment caused by a permittee's activities, DEQ may immediately revoke or refuse to renew the permit without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing. If no advance notice is provided, notification will be provided to the permittee as soon as possible under OAR 340-011-0525. The notification will set forth the specific reasons for the revocation or refusal to renew and will provide an opportunity for the permittee to request a contested case hearing for review of the revocation or refusal to renew. A permittee’s written request for hearing must be received by DEQ within 90 days of service of the notice on the permittee and must state the grounds for the request. The hearing will be conducted as a contested case hearing under ORS 183.413 through 183.470 and OAR chapter 340, division 011. The revocation or refusal to renew becomes final without further action by DEQ if a request for a hearing is not received within the 90 days. If a request for a hearing is timely received, the revocation or refusal to renew will remain in place until issuance of a final order.

(3) A source who has received Department approval for payment of the temporary closure fee must obtain authorization from DEQ prior to resuming permitted activities. An owner or operator of the source must submit written notification, together with the prorated annual fee for the remaining months of the year, to DEQ at least thirty (30) days before startup and specify in the notification the earliest anticipated startup date.
